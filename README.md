# Classification_of_Galaxy_Star_Quasar
This project focuses on the classification of celestial objects, specifically galaxies, stars, and quasars, using machine learning models. I developed an accurate and automated system that can classify astronomical objects based on their observed features using SDSS dataset.
I've used various tools and software for the implementation of the model along with machine learning classifiers such as decision tree, Logistic Regression, K -Nearest Neighbor, SVM to check the overall performance and accuracy of the model.
